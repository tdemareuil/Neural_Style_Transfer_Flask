# Neural_style_transfer_Flask

I built this simple app using `flask` to perform Neural Style Transfer (NST).

The app and models were inspired by several blog posts ([1], [2], [3], [4]), which themselves were based on the original NST [research article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by _Gatys et al._ (2016).

Examples of results:
